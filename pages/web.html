            <h1>The Internet</h1>
            <hr>
            <h3>What even is the internet?</h2>
            <p>The internet is a series of connected devices. These include phones, laptops, servers, smartfridges, and broadly anything that can talk to any other device.</p>
            <h3>How does the internet work?</h2>
            <p>The internet works by first splitting up data into chunks, called packets, then passing these packets from router to router until they reach their destination.</p>
            <h4>Why split up the data?</h4>
            <p>Splitting up the data solves a problem. When you download a video or other large file, there has to be <b id="gb-big-number">gigabytes</b> of data sent to you.</p>
            <p>This is a problem because if the data was all sent as one large stream, it would block other users: the routers would be busy trying to send your file, so they couldn't look at theirs.</p>
            <h4>How this problem was solved</h4>
            <p>This problem was solved by, as you have already seen, splitting it apart. Each tiny part, a few bytes, contains two parts.</p>
            <p>The first part is the header. This contains information like who it is from, and where it is going.</p>
            <p>The next part is the payload. This is the actual data that is trying to be sent from device to device.</p>
            <p>The header contains who it is in a similar way that postage has return addresses: if it gets stuck or sent back, it can return to the sender.</p>
            <h4>What is a router?</h4>
            <p>A router is a device that <span id="forward-name">forwards</span> packets between networks, including <span id="confusing-internetworks">internetworks</span> like the Internet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing)"> (Wikipedia)</a>.</p>
            <h5>Why can't you just send your data straight to the internet?</h5>
            <p>This is like trying to send and recieve mail without a mailbox and being banned from the mail office: you can't really send others anything, and there is no way for people to send you their mail.</p>
            <p>Another reason is like how there is mail offices in the first place. Many homes [devices] send their mail [packets] to the mail office [router] to process in bulk - your device isn't engineered for packet sending, but routers are.</p>

            <h2>Using the Internet</h2>
            <h3>Browsers</h3>
            <p>Browsers are the main form of internet usage for the average person. They let you send and recieve data through webpages, as well as view and interact with them.</p>
            <p>An example of a webpage you can interact with and view is this page itself. Your browser takes the <span id="html-explain"><i>HTML</i></span> and the <span id="css-explain"><i>CSS</i></span> of the webpage, as well as some <span id="js-explain"><i>JavaScript</i></span>, and then displays those three together. This is a very interesting process that will be covered once you learn more about these three individually.</p>
