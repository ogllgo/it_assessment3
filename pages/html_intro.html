            <h3>What is HTML</h3>
            <p>HTML is annoying</p>
            <p>HTML uses tags</p>
            <h2>How to use HTML</h2>
            <h3>Boilerplate</h3>
            <p>You first have to place some basic tags. Every HTML project looks like this at the start:</p>
            <p>First, you define the file as a HTML file, with the line</p>
            <pre><code>&lt!DOCTYPE HTML></code></pre>
            <p>It then wraps the rest of the file in a wrapper saying that it is HTML.</p>
            <pre><code>&lthtml>
...
&lt/html></code></pre>
            <p>Then, it defines the head of the document. This contains things such as the page title, which is set to be nothing. This is done by the lines</p>
            <pre><code>&lthead>
    &lttitle>&lt/title>
&lt/head></code></pre>
            <p>Finally, it defines the body of the document to be empty. The body is where you put the actual content of the page.</p>
            <pre><code>&ltbody>
    
&lt/body></code></pre>
            <p>The final blank page is like this.</p>
            <pre><code>&lt!DOCTYPE HTML>
&lthtml>
    &lthead>
        &lttitle>&lt/title>
    &lt/head>
    &ltbody>
        &lt!-- The webpage is empty --&gt
    &lt/body>
&lt/html></code></pre>
            <p>But how can you make your own site? Here's where tags come into play.</p>
            <h2>Tags</h2>
            <p>These are the tags that will be used to make your first webpage.</p>
            <h3>&ltp&gt</h3>
            <p>This tag lets people see text in the same was as this. The tag lets you write paragraph text.</p>
            <p>This is some example text for the tag `p`</p>
            <h3>&lth1&gt</h3>
            <p>This tag lets you make larger headers. This looks much larger than normal text. I use this for the largest headers, like the page title at the top.</span></p>
            <h1 class="contents-ignore">This is some example text for the tag h1</h1>
            <h3>&lth2&gt</h3>
            <p>This tag lets you make larger headers. This looks much larger than normal text, but smaller than h1. I use this for the subheaders, like `Tags`</span></p>
            <h2 class="contents-ignore">This is some example text for the tag h2</h2>
            <h3>&lth3&gt</h3>
            <p>This tag lets you make larger headers. This looks larger than smaller text, since it is smaller than h2. I use this for the smallest subheaders, like the tag names.</p>
            <h3 class="contents-ignore">This is some example text for the tag h3</h3>
        </div>
        <div id="navbar">
